# Crypto Text

This APP provides a way to transfer text data in an encrypted way over the internet without the need to save any information in a database.   
All informations are generated on the client and stored in the URL. So it is possible to send the encrypted data via an URL but without the risk some server hacks can leak the data â€“ since there is no database.


# start dev server
